    "Ans: ### Exception in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** in Python is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It usually occurs due to errors that happen during runtime, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an index that is out of range in a list, or trying to open a file that does not exist. Exceptions are a way for a program to handle unexpected conditions gracefully and are part of the error-handling mechanism in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between Exceptions and Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nature**:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: These are related to the syntax or structure of the code. They occur when the Python parser encounters code that does not conform to the syntax rules of the language. For example, missing colons, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: These are related to the semantics or logic of the code and can be due to conditions that are not syntactically wrong but are problematic during execution. For instance, division by zero, accessing an undefined variable, or trying to perform an operation on incompatible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detection Time**:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Detected at compile-time, which is before the program starts running. The Python interpreter parses the code and identifies syntax errors before executing any part of the program.\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Detected at runtime, meaning they occur while the program is running. The interpreter encounters an exception when it reaches the problematic code during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling**:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Cannot be handled by the program. The presence of a syntax error prevents the program from running. The error must be corrected by the programmer for the code to execute.\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Can be handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This allows the program to manage errors gracefully and continue running or terminate in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Impact**:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Stop the program from running altogether until they are fixed. They are fundamental issues in the code structure.\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Can be anticipated and managed, allowing the program to handle unexpected situations and either recover from them or exit gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples**:\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Include things like missing colons, unmatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, or the use of undeclared variables.\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Include errors such as `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, and many others that can be caught and handled during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between syntax errors and exceptions is crucial for debugging and writing robust Python programs. Syntax errors need to be fixed in the code for it to run, whereas exceptions can be managed to ensure the program handles unexpected conditions effectively."

    "### What Happens When an Exception is Not Handled?\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it causes the program to terminate immediately. The Python interpreter stops executing the current program and generates an error message that includes the type of the exception, a description of the error, and a traceback. The traceback shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error, helping developers identify where and why the exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Python code that attempts to divide a number by zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the function `divide` attempts to divide `10` by `0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. Since there is no exception handling mechanism (such as `try` and `except` blocks) in place, the program will terminate and generate an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When the above code is executed, the following output will be produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traceback**: The output includes a traceback that shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception. It starts with the most recent call and goes back to the point where the exception was raised.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exception Type**: The type of the exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) is displayed, indicating what kind of error occurred.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Error Message**: The error message provides a brief description of the problem (`division by zero`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consequences of Not Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Program Termination**: The program terminates abruptly, and any code after the point where the exception occurred is not executed. This can lead to incomplete operations and loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Poor User Experience**: Unhandled exceptions result in error messages being displayed to the user, which can be confusing and unhelpful. This reduces the overall user experience and reliability of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Leaks**: Resources such as files or network connections may remain open if an exception occurs and is not handled properly, leading to resource leaks and potential system issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Difficulty in Debugging**: While the traceback provides information about where the error occurred, the abrupt termination of the program makes it harder to diagnose and fix the underlying issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks is crucial for writing robust and user-friendly Python programs. It allows the programmer to manage errors gracefully, ensuring that the program can recover from unexpected situations or terminate cleanly, providing meaningful feedback to the user."

    "### Python Statements to Catch and Handle Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions can be caught and handled using the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try`**: The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block.\n",
    "2. **`except`**: The code inside the `except` block is executed if an exception occurs in the `try` block. Different types of exceptions can be caught by specifying the exception name.\n",
    "3. **`else`**: The code inside the `else` block is executed if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
    "4. **`finally`**: The code inside the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**:\n",
    "   - The code that could potentially raise an exception (`a / b`) is placed inside the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Block**:\n",
    "   - **`ZeroDivisionError`**: If the code in the `try` block raises a `ZeroDivisionError` (e.g., division by zero), the corresponding `except` block is executed.\n",
    "   - **`TypeError`**: If the code in the `try` block raises a `TypeError` (e.g., invalid input types), the corresponding `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`else` Block**:\n",
    "   - If no exception occurs in the `try` block, the code inside the `else` block is executed. This block is useful for code that should only run if the `try` block did not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block**:\n",
    "   - The code inside the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This ensures that cleanup code (such as releasing resources) is run in all circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Custom Exceptions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that extend the built-in `Exception` class. They allow you to create specific error types that can make your code more readable and easier to debug. Custom exceptions are useful for handling specific error conditions in your application in a way that is more informative than using generic exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Custom Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity**: Custom exceptions allow you to specify the exact error condition that occurred, making your error handling more precise.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: They make the code more readable and maintainable by providing meaningful exception names.\n",
    "3. **Modularity**: Custom exceptions help in creating modular code where each module can raise its own specific exceptions.\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: They allow you to handle different types of errors in different ways, improving the robustness of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that demonstrates how to create and use custom exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Define Custom Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NegativeNumberError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised for errors in the input if the number is negative.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, number, message=\"Number is negative. Positive number expected.\"):\n",
    "        self.number = number\n",

    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Use Custom Exceptions in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now use these custom exceptions in your code to handle specific error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_number(number):\n",
    "    if number < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeNumberError(number)\n",

    "    check_number(50)\n",
    "except (NegativeNumberError, TooLargeNumberError) as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No exception occurred.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - `NegativeNumberError` is raised when the input number is negative.\n",
    "   - `TooLargeNumberError` is raised when the input number is greater than 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - The function `check_number` checks if the input number meets certain conditions and raises the appropriate custom exception if it does not.\n",
    "   - The `try` block calls the `check_number` function and handles the specific custom exceptions using `except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Number is negative. Positive number expected.\n",
    "Error: Number is too large.\n",
    "Number is valid: 50\n",
    "No exception occurred.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are a powerful feature that allows you to create more specific and informative error messages. They improve code readability, maintainability, and robustness by allowing you to handle different types of errors in a structured and meaningful way."
